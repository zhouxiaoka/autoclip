00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hey, what's up, I'm KBHD here, and welcome to your first look and hands-on of everything

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,360
Apple just unveiled today at their 2025 September event.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,760
This is iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Air.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,800
Definitely get subscribed to be among the first to see the full reviews when they come

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,920
out, but this is my first impressions, and I actually found it pretty simple to synthesize

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,800
my thoughts on everything they announced today.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,040
But there is some good tech, there's some interesting new designs, and some questionable

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,000
decisions, but the funny thing is, you know, as I go to these events and as I think about

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,080
all this stuff, what usually happens is I end up typically getting some texts from friends

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,040
asking what I think of the announcements, and my mental task is to summarize everything

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm thinking about into one or two easily digestible sentences or just words to understand

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,120
what's new and what happened.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,680
I don't want to tell them too much information.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,360
And so that's what I'm going to give you about each of the things Apple announced today.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm going to give you my super, super compressed version of what I saw.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,640
So let's just start with the iPhone 17, right, the base new iPhones.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,000
My ultra simple summary for the iPhone 17 would be, hey, it got Pro motion and a better

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,280
selfie camera, and the rest is mostly the same.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,560
So the design is mostly unchanged other than the new colors, same screen sizes, same dimensions,

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,880
same camera bump, same buttons and camera control, which they barely talked about.

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,000
But there's a new A19 chip inside, which we expected.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,800
That should see some nice performance gains and efficiency bumps, roughly 20% faster CPU,

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,240
which is nice, and battery life should be a few beats longer.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,000
And the display is brighter too, getting up to 3,000 nits.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,720
But this is the first time we are seeing a pro branded feature on a non pro iPhone, because

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,400
every new iPhone across the range now has pro motion.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,680
And it's the same pro motion too.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,200
It's the adaptive one to 120 hertz doesn't seem to be handicapped at all.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
It's funny.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
We always used to have that regular people don't care about 120 hertz argument.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,920
But now here it is on the new base iPhones.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,320
So hey, sounds great to me.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,880
This makes the base iPhones much more usable.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,920
And so does the new base storage of 256 gigs.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,960
So those are welcome upgrades.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,400
But the other new thing was the selfie camera.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
And it was funny.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
The keynote was pretty chill up until the point where they started to talk about this.

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,920
And it was actually the loudest applause and it was really tempting to make fun of it.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,360
But I actually do think this is really clever, because all these new iPhones have this massively

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
upgraded selfie camera system.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,440
They're calling it center stage, but I actually think that kind of does a disservice because

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,400
the actual center stage on their laptop and stuff is kind of annoying.

44
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,000
So what's happening is with these phones, they all have a larger 24 megapixel square

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
selfie camera sensor.

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,600
And so then when you go to take a selfie, the phone can take a regular vertical selfie or

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,280
can manually or even automatically take a horizontal selfie without you having to rotate the phone.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
And honestly, this might be genius.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
Like the default for most people is obviously to take a vertical selfie now, it just fits

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
on the phone.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,360
You're probably viewing it on the phone.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,000
But if you go to take a horizontal selfie to fit more people, suddenly the camera lens

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,800
is off to the side and it's a little bit less natural looking.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,000
So now since the selfie camera is larger and a square, it can literally just crop an 18

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,440
megapixel selfie in portrait or landscape.

56
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,920
And for videos or photos, it's, I think it's great, it's very useful.

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,360
It might be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone 17.

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,600
So then there's the iPhone 17 pro.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,320
And my quick, friendly summary of the pro phones is, hey, they got better zoom and more

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,360
battery and orange.

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,320
So the pro iPhones actually look a little bit different.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,880
There's actually quite a bit going on here with this new design.

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,840
First of all, there's only three colors, cosmic orange, deep blue, and silver.

64
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,560
Really bummed me out that there's no black pro phone.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,200
But then I remembered Dbrand exists, never mind.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,320
But then the thing that's going to catch everyone's eye on the back is the camera bar

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
up at the top, which is what Apple keeps calling on their keynote plateau.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,960
It kind of looks a little bit like the pixels visor or frankly what we've been seeing on

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,120
a ton of other Android phones for years now, just a huge bar across the top of the back

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,520
of the phone.

71
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,320
But it's actually not just cameras in here.

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,520
Apple's done some rearranging of the insides of the phone to actually shove more components

73
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,120
like the A19 pro chip and the logic board and storage up here in that bar so they could

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,480
fill out more of the bottom of the phone with more battery.

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,520
And that approach is going to make even more sense in a little bit.

76
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,680
But my first reaction to that is, oh yeah, great.

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,040
That sounds like these pro phones might actually come with a real substantial battery upgrade

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,200
from last year, which is again very welcome.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,640
Now, you might also notice some other little things like the millimeter wave antenna at

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,640
the top of the phone and the ring around that plateau actually also being an antenna.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,960
But then the other new design element is that they actually switched back to aluminum,

82
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,400
which is interesting because we just saw like two years ago, the iPhone 15 pro's whole

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,480
thing was titanium, the new titanium color and titanium rails and it was a whole big deal.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,560
But now they're switching back to aluminum in a unibody form because it's much better

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
thermally.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,120
And so there's also a new vapor chamber right in the middle of the back of this phone.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,280
First time we've seen a vapor chamber on the iPhone.

88
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,280
And so this new cooling system and new unibody aluminum build should mean the iPhone shouldn't

89
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,520
get nearly as hot from sustained loads to the chip, which is different from normal bursty

90
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,560
quick on and off workloads of everyday use.

91
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm talking more about like rendering long videos or playing an intense game for a long

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,000
time with ray tracing at high frame rates.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,760
This phone should be able to keep cool and keep that performance high without overheating.

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,080
Apple is saying 40% better sustained performance.

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,160
So yeah, this design is just a little bit more than meets the eye, you know, rearranging

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,000
some components here and there being more efficient, better cooling and better battery.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,880
The number that they quoted on stage was 39 hours of video playback, which whatever dumb

98
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,200
stat video playback is kind of ridiculous.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,600
But okay, we'll take that and I also looked up the iPhone 16 Pro Max's video playback

100
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,680
and that was also a great battery life phone.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,000
That one quoted 33 hours.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,480
So maybe up to like 10% battery life on this phone, which is sick.

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,120
And then there's the cameras that I mentioned, they always go hard with pro phones and cameras

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,320
and this generation is no exception with the main improvement being the new 48 megapixel

105
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,000
4x telephoto camera.

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,720
Now 4x might be a lesser number than last year's 5x, but that was a smaller 12 megapixel sensor.

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,040
This new zoom camera is a 56% larger sensor and has way more resolution, it's 48 megapixels.

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,880
So that is a smaller gap between the main camera and the zoom.

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,640
And you should be able to continue to zoom further and crop more with less consequence

110
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,880
now that you have 48 megapixels.

111
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,240
The pro phones also get the new selfie camera, they also get the new brighter display,

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
he's also got cheat to support, and then they also got some seriously pro features that

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm looking forward to testing like Genlock Sync support and also ProRes RAW video, which

114
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,120
I will hopefully be getting to test in an autofocus video coming up very soon.

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,880
But of course there was one more new iPhone, the iPhone Air.

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,080
No number, just Air.

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,480
And y'all know what that means, they're doing the ultra thin thing and they're leaning

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,880
in hard.

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:45,640
So this thing is a stunningly ridiculously thin 5.6mm at the thinnest part.

120
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,400
And you can tell from the commercial as you can tell from my footage here, and the first

121
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,880
time I hold the phone, it has the same effect on me that the S25 Edge did from Samsung,

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,760
which is just, it's so sick, like clearly nobody's asking for thinner phones, but once

123
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,600
you hold one, it is pretty impressive that they're able to make something like this.

124
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,600
But there are also absolutely some red flags that come along with this.

125
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,480
So the basics are, it's a 6.5 inch pro motion display, it's got the A19 Pro chip inside,

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,680
titanium body, the new selfie camera of course is in there, and it has a single 48 megapixel

127
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,440
fusion camera on the back with the new design again, same camera as the iPhone 17, but

128
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,640
with the nice plateau from the pro phone.

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,440
And then there's a new N1 chip inside for all the networking connectivity, which is

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, thread, and a new, more energy efficient C1X modem for cellular.

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,000
I put out a short that basically already said this, but I really think this phone is going

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,480
to be a hard sell, because if you subtract emotions from it, it's just, it's the worst

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
one.

134
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,880
This is going to jump in the lineup at 999, it replaces essentially the plus phones in

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
the lineup.

136
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,000
It's founded by other iPhones that are better than it in basically every way, other than

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,760
being super thin and light.

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
So it's a fascinating gamble.

139
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,200
This phone has the same A19 pro chip in it as the pro phones, minus one GPU core.

140
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Interesting choice.

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Apparently it's a bit more efficient than the base A19, so that's good for battery life.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,160
But we also just heard a whole long list of choices Apple made with the pro phones to make

143
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,800
them more thermally efficient to not overheat, switching from titanium to aluminum, and adding

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,880
a vapor chamber to the back.

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,880
But this phone is still titanium, and absolutely does not have room for an advanced thermal solution

146
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
or any sort of vapor chamber.

147
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,960
So it sounds like this phone could get much hotter and throttle performance much quicker.

148
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,200
It's a red flag.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Now we also know that ultra thin phones have a tendency to be a little bit less durable.

150
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,800
They've bent over the years, and I'm not going to be the first one to point this out.

151
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,320
I mean, I'm sure already glued to Jerry Regarething's channel for his bend test.

152
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
And Apple of course has thought about this.

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,680
They've for sure tested this.

154
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,320
And they're telling us it's the most durable iPhone ever.

155
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,720
But I mean, I'm looking at the phone and I think it qualifies also as a red flag.

156
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,800
And then we already know there is just no way battery life can be good on this phone.

157
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Right?

158
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
There's just no way.

159
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
It's for more than a decade.

160
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,320
And all signs point to it being trash.

161
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,840
There was a slide in the keynote today about how they were still proud to achieve all day

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,080
battery life.

163
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,600
But like, come on.

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Really?

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,480
I mean, they still do the thing where they rearrange the components up until the little plateau

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
at the top to make room for more battery at the bottom.

167
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,360
But there is just absolutely not enough room in this phone for a large battery.

168
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,360
And it doesn't appear to be silicon carbon or any sort of a special ultra high density

169
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
battery.

170
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,880
And Apple also announced it alongside a special dedicated MagSafe battery accessory just

171
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,240
for this phone that adds 3,149 million powers.

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,920
And just barely combined will match the 17 pro in terms of quoted video playback.

173
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,280
So if that doesn't scream red flag, I don't know what to tell you.

174
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,840
It is also eSIM only globally because there's no room in any version of the phone for a plastic

175
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
SIM card.

176
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,920
There's also no millimeter wave 5G.

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,520
And like I said, it's coming in at $1,000, which is more expensive than the base iPhone,

178
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,400
which will have a better camera system and better battery life and may overheat less.

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,480
So look, I think there's two ways to look at this phone.

180
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,880
This is either Apple just throwing something new at the wall and seeing if it sticks.

181
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,520
Like we just saw them try, okay, they had the mini phone for like two years and that really

182
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
didn't sell that well.

183
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,600
So then they moved to the plus and that was also a little bit underwhelming.

184
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,360
So now they're trying that same spot in the lineup for an ultra thin phone and seeing

185
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,800
if maybe they can market that to turn into some more sales.

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,240
So you can see it as that or you can see this as a visionary, long time in the making

187
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,280
preview at the future of all phones, like maybe someday in the future, every phone will

188
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
be this thin.

189
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,040
And Apple is just now today getting the tech together with the battery and display and

190
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,520
modem and Apple Silicon to make this phone possible.

191
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,880
Maybe kind of like how the first MacBook Air sucked and was underpowered, but then eventually

192
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,440
all laptops became that thin.

193
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,680
Maybe that's also what's going to happen to smartphones.

194
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,280
And maybe the same way Samsung made the ultra thin S25 Edge and then a few months later

195
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,840
they came out with their super thin foldable the Z Fold 7 and I felt like the edge phone

196
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,080
was one half of that foldable.

197
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,920
Maybe that's also what Apple is doing.

198
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,160
Maybe we're going to see an ultra thin foldable iPhone next year maybe either way.

199
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,120
I do think it's clear that you probably won't find too many logical reasons to pick up

200
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,680
this first gen iPhone Air, but I do also think that picking it up and holding it is going

201
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,720
to convince a lot of people because it's pretty stunning in person.

202
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,360
And it's the same thing I said about the Samsung phone is pretty sick.

203
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
But only time will tell for that part of the story.

204
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
Now there were a couple other announcements today.

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,520
There were new AirPods Pro 3 which have twice as good A and C as the last gen which is

206
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,000
crazy plus IP57 and heart rate tracking during workouts all the same $250 price.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,320
Definitely going to test those.

208
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,720
And there's also a new Apple Watch Series 11 now with 5G and possible hypertension detection

209
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,240
and a slightly new watch Ultra 3 with thinner bezels, LTPO 3 and slightly longer battery

210
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
life.

211
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,800
All this stuff over the next couple of weeks.

212
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,320
So get subscribed and I'll see you in those videos.

213
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,120
And shout out to Channel Sponsor Ridge for being ahead of the game because while the iPhone

214
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,420
Air does lack battery, it does still have MagSafe which means you're going to want to pick

215
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,920
up a Ridge power bank.

216
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,900
I've seen plenty of power banks over my 15 years of reviewing tech but this Ridge one quickly

217
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
became a favorite.

218
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,120
It's got five ways to charge, 15 watt MagSafe compatible wireless charging, two built-in

219
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,100
cables, USB type C up to 20 watts and lightning for older Apple devices and a charging pad

220
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,440
for your Apple Watch.

221
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,320
Pass through charging so it doubles as a hub and it also comes in three colors, matte

222
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,240
black, matte olive and I guess perfect for the new iPhone 17 Pro color, base camp orange.

223
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,800
Ridge also makes a MagSafe card holder that snaps right onto your iPhone and holds up to

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,080
three cards.

225
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,240
Every Ridge product comes with a lifetime warranty and a 99 day risk free trial.

226
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,920

227
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,560
