1
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:07,691
In the 1920's,

2
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:10,184
the German mathematician David Hilbert

3
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,437
devised a famous thought experiment

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,191
to show us just how hard it is

5
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:17,665
to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity.

6
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:21,659
Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms

7
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,988
and a very hardworking night manager.

8
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:27,523
One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full,

9
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:31,003
totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests.

10
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:34,161
A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room.

11
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,444
Rather than turn him down,

12
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,907
the night manager decides
to make room for him.

13
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:38,947
How?

14
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,635
Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1

15
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,711
to move to room 2,

16
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:46,056
the guest in room 2 to move to room 3,

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,138
and so on.

18
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,838
Every guest moves from room number "n"

19
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:52,179
to room number "n+1".

20
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,812
Since there are an infinite
number of rooms,

21
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:57,009
there is a new room
for each existing guest.

22
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,760
This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer.

23
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:01,070
The process can be repeated

24
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,511
for any finite number of new guests.

25
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:07,529
If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms,

26
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,642
then every existing guest just moves

27
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,980
from room number "n"

28
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,638
to room number "n+40",

29
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:16,200
thus, opening up the first 40 rooms.

30
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:19,171
But now an infinitely large bus

31
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:21,744
with a countably infinite
number of passengers

32
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:23,673
pulls up to rent rooms.

33
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:25,686
countably infinite is the key.

34
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:28,530
Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers

35
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:30,518
perplexes the night manager at first,

36
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,010
but he realizes there's a way

37
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:33,349
to place each new person.

38
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,391
He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2.

39
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:38,527
He then asks the guest in room 2

40
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,435
to move to room 4,

41
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,809
the guest in room 3 to move to room 6,

42
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,105
and so on.

43
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,313
Each current guest moves
from room number "n"

44
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,029
to room number "2n" --

45
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:54,060
filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms.

46
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,929
By doing this, he has now emptied

47
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:58,867
all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms,

48
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,506
which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus.

49
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:06,875
Everyone's happy and the hotel's business
is booming more than ever.

50
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,416
Well, actually, it is booming
exactly the same amount as ever,

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,923
banking an infinite number
of dollars a night.

52
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:16,355
Word spreads about this incredible hotel.

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,544
People pour in from far and wide.

54
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,842
One night, the unthinkable happens.

55
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,407
The night manager looks outside

56
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,517
and sees an infinite line
of infinitely large buses,

57
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,329
each with a countably infinite
number of passengers.

58
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:31,386
What can he do?

59
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,207
If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out

60
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,958
on an infinite amount of money,

61
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:37,955
and he will surely lose his job.

62
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,790
Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E.,

63
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:44,726
Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity

64
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,634
of prime numbers.

65
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,660
So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task

66
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,285
of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses

67
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:54,291
of infinite weary travelers,

68
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:57,182
the night manager assigns
every current guest

69
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:59,042
to the first prime number, 2,

70
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,867
raised to the power
of their current room number.

71
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,535
So, the current occupant of room number 7

72
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,541
goes to room number 2^7,

73
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:09,261
which is room 128.

74
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,757
The night manager then takes the people
on the first of the infinite buses

75
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,806
and assigns them to the room number

76
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,291
of the next prime, 3,

77
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:21,728
raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus.

78
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:25,259
So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus

79
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:28,360
goes to room number 3^7

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,610
or room number 2,187.

81
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:34,069
This continues for all of the first bus.

82
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,741
The passengers on the second bus

83
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:39,410
are assigned powers of the next prime, 5.

84
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,493
The following bus, powers of 7.

85
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:42,921
Each bus follows:

86
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,746
powers of 11, powers of 13,

87
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,799
powers of 17, etc.

88
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,729
Since each of these numbers

89
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,968
only has 1 and the natural number powers

90
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:53,213
of their prime number base as factors,

91
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:55,386
there are no overlapping room numbers.

92
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,339
All the buses' passengers
fan out into rooms

93
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,846
using unique room-assignment schemes

94
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,486
based on unique prime numbers.

95
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,701
In this way, the night
manager can accommodate

96
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,846
every passenger on every bus.

97
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,064
Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled,

98
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:12,356
like room 6,

99
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,095
since 6 is not a power
of any prime number.

100
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,512
Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math,

101
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,875
so his job is safe.

102
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:22,007
The night manager's strategies
are only possible

103
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:26,624
because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare,

104
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:29,957
it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity,

105
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,513
mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers,

106
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:36,594
1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

107
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:40,513
Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero.

108
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:43,042
We use natural numbers
for the room numbers

109
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,188
as well as the seat numbers on the buses.

110
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,252
If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity,

111
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,848
such as that of the real numbers,

112
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,844
these structured strategies
would no longer be possible

113
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:56,405
as we have no way
to systematically include every number.

114
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,803
The Real Number Infinite Hotel

115
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,905
has negative number rooms in the basement,

116
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,364
fractional rooms,

117
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,484
so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects

118
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:07,181
he has less room than the guy in room 1.

119
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:10,308
Square root rooms, like room radical 2,

120
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:11,438
and room pi,

121
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,325
where the guests expect free dessert.

122
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,374
What self-respecting night manager
would ever want to work there

123
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,005
even for an infinite salary?

124
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,918
But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel,

125
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,420
where there's never any vacancy

126
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:24,004
and always room for more,

127
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:26,926
the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent

128
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,760
and maybe too hospitable night manager

129
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:31,490
serve to remind us of just how hard it is

130
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,905
for our relatively finite minds

131
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,767
to grasp a concept as large as infinity.

132
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:39,083
Maybe you can help tackle these problems

133
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,403
after a good night's sleep.

134
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,276
But honestly, we might need you

135
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,701
to change rooms at 2 a.m.
